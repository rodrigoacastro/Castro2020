In order to convert pdf files to txt format, all these folders must be together in a master folder (let's say "convert_pdfs_txts_shell", so all you need to do is:

1) put all pdf files you want to convert in the folder "pdf_files"
2) run the file "pdf2text_currentdir.sh"
3) check in the command line window if there was any error in the conversion process
4) if not, collect the converted txt files in the folder "txt_files"
5) open the txt files and verify their quality (some errors are expected but the file should not be completely corrupted)
6) remove the correctly converted txt files from the "txt_files" folder and their respective pdfs from the "pdf_files"
7) as a last measure,  try the process again for those that were not converted after doing step 6

Other than that, good work!
