# Castro2021

These files are associated with the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and Macquarie University PhD thesis: Castro (2021), by Rodrigo Ara√∫jo e Castro, available at the Poslin and Macquarie University websites at the time of its completion.

All source texts and scripts processed in the thesis analysis.

Due to Filemaker license issues, the files in the folder "Outdated - Classified Set A and Set B" are outdated, categorizing the segments into Set A and Set B only, not Set A, Set B, Set C and Set D.

The file "SysFan2019_Castro(2020)_FINAL_updated_sets" follows the proper arrangement: naturally occurring segments from Set A should be regarded as Set A, naturally occurring segments from Set B as Set B, manually created segments from Set A as Set C and manually created segments as Set D.  

Despite that, adjustments were made manually in the thesis draft to ensure that the results at the thesis remain updated.
