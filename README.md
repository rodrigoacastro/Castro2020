Due to Filemaker license issues, the files are outdated, categorizing the segments into Set A and Set B only, not Set A, Set B, Set C and Set D. For the proper arrangement, naturally occurring segments from Set A should be regarded as Set A, naturally occurring segments from Set B as Set B, manually created segments from Set A as Set C and manually created segments as Set D.
